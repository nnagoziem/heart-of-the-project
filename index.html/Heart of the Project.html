            <p2> Gotta show y'all the pictures first before I say anything. First time I set my eyes on her I said surely the world has come to an end or it must be a vision. What could an angel be doing on earth amongst us, I thought to myself "surely you must get to know this girl" and I did. The person I'm most grateful I met after my family. Didnt think anything could be more beautiful than her looks until I got to know and and her personality. I wasssssnnnnntttt worthy I thought to myself most times but here we are -_- </p2>
